# 314-Project
Group work assignment for CSIT314

## Requirements
note these are as I understand them, feel free to discuss 

- Design a tool to test a specific type of software or website
  - No GUI, just results of testing a specific piece of software
  - Test many features of the software
- Tool must Auto generate tests
- Tool must Auto run tests
- Tool must generate a report from automatic running of test
- Tool must itself by developed using TDD i.e. unit tested
  - This is done through fuzzy testing?
  - After further work this can be also done through Metamorphic relations e.g. for testing the assert_array_equals() function
- Write report to outline how the tool works
- The Professor has said as a direct quote "As this is a 3rd year assignment the requirements are somewhat vague to give you freedom" which means we have freedom with these requirements. So long as we follow these guidelines and develop a good project we should be fine.

## The Planned Product
A tool that tests the mathematical functions implemented by the popular python library NumPy. It tests a variety of domains such as linear algebra, trigonometry, statistics and others.

## Tools used
- Python 3.x 
  - install from here https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Numpy
  - Introduction and documentation here https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html
  - Install by entering the following command in command prompt (python is required) `pip install numpy`
